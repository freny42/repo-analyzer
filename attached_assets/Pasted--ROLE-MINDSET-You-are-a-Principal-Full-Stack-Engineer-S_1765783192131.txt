🧠 ROLE & MINDSET

You are a Principal Full-Stack Engineer + Senior UI/UX Product Designer building a professional developer intelligence platform.

You think like:

A Principal Software Architect reviewing real-world systems

A Tech Lead assessing long-term maintainability

A Hiring Panel Evaluator judging engineering maturity

This is not a demo, not a tutorial, and not a GitHub clone.

This is a portfolio-grade, recruiter-respectable product.

🎯 PRODUCT VISION (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Build a Dark-Themed GitHub Repository Intelligence Platform that answers:

“Is this repository healthy, well-engineered, and production-ready — beyond stars and commits?”

Priority Rule

✅ Repository Analyzer = PRIMARY PRODUCT

➖ Profile Analyzer = SECONDARY CONTEXT ONLY

This is repository intelligence, not a social profile viewer.

🧱 TECH STACK (STRICT)
Frontend

React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS

lucide-react (icons only)

Recharts (data visualization)

Framer Motion (mandatory, subtle + premium)

Data

Mock data only

No GitHub API

Mock data must be realistic and backend-ready

🌑 DESIGN SYSTEM (MODERN & PREMIUM)
Theme

Dark charcoal / slate base (❌ no pure black)

Soft contrast, eye-friendly

Calm, premium SaaS vibe

Clean surfaces with depth

No clutter, no noise

Color Strategy (Very Important)

Use intentional gradients, not decoration.

🟢 Green → Healthy / Stable

🟡 Amber → Warnings / Needs attention

🔴 Red → Risk / Issues

🟣 Purple → Intelligence / Analysis

🔵 Blue → Popularity / Activity

Gradients should be:

Subtle

Directional

Used for emphasis, not everywhere

Motion & Interaction (Framer Motion)

Page enter transitions (fade + slide)

Card hover lift (y-axis + shadow)

Chart reveal animations

Section staggered loading

Everything feels alive but calm

No flashy animations.
Think Linear / Vercel / Raycast, not Dribbble hype.

🧭 WEBSITE PAGES
1️⃣ Home Page — First 5 Seconds Matter

Purpose: Instantly communicate value and credibility.

Hero Section

Headline:

“Understand GitHub repositories beyond stars.”

Subtext:

Architecture. Code quality. Engineering maturity.

Repo input: owner/repo

Primary CTA:
Analyze Repository →

Feature Preview Cards (Icon-First)

🧱 Architecture Quality

🫀 Code Health

📘 Documentation

🚀 Production Readiness

Cards:

Glassy dark surfaces

Subtle gradient borders

Motion on hover

Clearly clickable

2️⃣ Repository Analyzer Page (CORE PRODUCT)

This page must feel expensive, intelligent, and authoritative.

🔹 Repo Header

Repository name (hero weight)

Owner (secondary)

Visibility badge (🔓 / 🔒)

Short description

Icons always come first.

🔹 Core Repository Stats (Reusable Cards)

Icon → Big Number → Label

⭐ Stars

🍴 Forks

🐞 Open Issues

🔄 Commits

🕒 Last Updated

Cards must:

Feel critical

Animate on load

Elevate on hover

Be reusable components

🔹 Repository Analysis Sections (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each section must feel like a staff-level engineer review, not documentation.

1. Executive Summary

TL;DR paragraph

Verdict badges (color-coded)

2. Engineering Mindset & Intent

Problem clarity

Signal vs noise

Product thinking vs random features

3. Architecture & System Design

Folder structure

Modularity

Separation of concerns

10× / 100× scalability readiness

4. Code Quality & Maintainability

Readability

Reusability

Technical debt risk

5. Git & Engineering Discipline

Commit clarity

Consistency

Team-readiness

6. Documentation & DX

README depth

Onboarding friction

7. Testing & Reliability

Test presence

Error handling

Confidence level

8. Performance, Security & Best Practices

Perf risks

Security risks

Deployment safety

9. Project Maturity Classification

🟡 Prototype

🟢 Production-Ready

🔵 Scalable Foundation

🔴 Experimental

Badge + short explanation.

🔹 Visual Intelligence (Charts)

Charts support insight — they never dominate.

Each chart:

Icon + title

Animated entry

Clean dark styling

Charts:

🧠 Language Usage (Pie)

📈 Commit Activity Timeline

📊 Issues vs Resolutions

🔹 Engineering Insight Cards

Short, high-signal, one-line insights:

🔥 Actively maintained repository

⚠️ Issues accumulate faster than resolution

📘 README lacks usage examples

🚀 Strong foundation for scaling

🔹 Hiring Perspective

Recruiter-style verdict:

Would this impress a hiring panel?

Suitable roles

Expected developer level

What’s holding it back?

🔹 Scoring System

Scores (0–10):

Architecture & Design

Code Quality

Maintainability

Documentation

Professional Practices

Production Readiness

Compute:

Overall Engineering Maturity Score (0–100)

🔹 Actionable Improvement Roadmap

Split clearly:

✅ Short-term (1–2 weeks)

🚀 Long-term (1–3 months)

3️⃣ Profile Context (SECONDARY)

Minimal and quiet:

Avatar

Username

Followers

GitHub link

Never competes with repo analysis.

🧩 COMPONENT & ARCHITECTURE RULES

Reusable components only

Icons before text

Rounded cards

Soft shadows

Clear hover & focus states

Framer Motion everywhere (subtle)

🏁 QUALITY BAR (FINAL)

This must feel like:

A real SaaS developer intelligence tool

Something recruiters and senior engineers respect

A top-tier portfolio project

Calm, dark, modern, insight-driven

Confident, not flashy

⚠️ FINAL RULE

This is a Repository Intelligence Platform.
Profiles exist only as context, never as the product.
